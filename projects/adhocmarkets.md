summary: Flex-E-Markets is a trading platform heavily used in many institutions around the world for experimental and markets studies. As part of the University of Utah Laboratory for Experimental Economics & Finance, I was in charge of developing over more than 10 trading algorithms, experiments, and applications for the platform.Including Robo-Trading, Risk Management, Market Analysis, and a wide range of trading experiments. Most of the development was done in Java, manged using Apache Maven.
