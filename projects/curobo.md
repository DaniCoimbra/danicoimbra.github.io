<h1>Motion Gen - NVIDIA cuRobo</h1>
  <p>
    This project involved 2 major steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CAD Modelling:</strong> Design and creation of several CAD models, incorporating joint and kinematic properties in a complex URDF format, with extreme precision.</li>
    <li><strong>Motion Script:</strong> Development on a motion generation script for the robot, incorporating Robot and World configuration, as well as integration of NVIDIA cuRobo library to generate fast GPU powered motion plans.</li>
  </ul>
