<h2>Gif Generation</h2>
<p>
  As another feature, users can merge their sprites into a gif, allowing for playback speed
  customization in fps, and for a playback reverse button. Finally, the software is capable of saving/loading a project, and adding new sprites to the existing project, that is possible with the use of JSON, storing the grid state by each pixel setting.
